/**
 * Provides the classes necessary for data transfer objects (DTOs)
 * between different layers of the application.
 *
 * <p>DTOs are used to encapsulate data, and they provide a layer of abstraction
 * which can help protect your application from changes. They are particularly
 * useful for passing data between the service layer and controllers, and for
 * structuring the data sent over the network.</p>
 *
 * <p>This package contains the {@link co.udea.airline.api.model.DTO.auth.PersonRegistrationDTO}
 * which is responsible for carrying person registration data from clients to the server for processing.</p>
